    <h1>Learning from Losses: Tracking UFC Fighters' Improvements</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I never lose. I either win or learn."</em></p>
<p>— <strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, he was a great fighter, but what the hell does that guy know about losing, considering he was undefeated in the UFC and retired with a 29-0-0 record?</p>
<p>The saying, <em>"What goes around, comes around"</em>, seems very poignant in sports: at some point, you're going to lose (unless you're Khabib). And while a loss in most sports isn't too devastating, in combat sports, a loss or two can be the inflection point of your career. Without a good win rate, fickle fans can turn on a fighter, and they can find themselves getting dropped from the UFC roster after only a few loses.</p>
<p>But truly great fighters don't just win: they lose, and come back better.</p>
<p>People love an underdog: we see ourselves in those who fail, and find it cathartic watching them come back to eventually succeed. </p>
<p>By turning fight history into time series, we’ll attempt to answer a deceptively simple question: <strong>Do UFC fighters get better after they lose?</strong></p>
