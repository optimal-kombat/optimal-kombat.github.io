&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I never lose. I either win or learn."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Khabib Nurmagomedov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that guy know about losing? It's a bold quote from an undefeated UFC fighter with a 29-0 record - he didn't have many chances to "learn".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sports, at some point, you're going to lose (unless you're Khabib). And while a loss in most sports isn't too devastating, in combat sports, one or two losses can be the inflection point of your career. Without a good win rate, fickle fans can turn on a fighter, who suddenly find themselves dropped from the UFC roster after just a few losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people love an underdog: we see ourselves in flawed individuals who fail, and find it cathartic watching them fight their way back to eventually succeed. It gives us hope that one day, we too might overcome a failure to come back better and succeed in our own lives. To me, it seems that the issue people have is not with losing, but with not improving and working on your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good fighters win, but truly great fighters don't just win: they lose — and come back better. Or, do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dustin Poirier said, &lt;em&gt;"It's not about how you start. It's about how you bounce back."&lt;/em&gt; But is that really true? Do fighters come back stronger — or just come back? In this article, I’ll attempt to answer a deceptively simple question: &lt;strong&gt;Do UFC fighters get better after they lose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Throwing Combinations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="{filename}/data-scraping.md"&gt;Scraps and Scrapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we pulled raw fight stats from UFCStats — numbers like strikes landed, takedowns attempts, and control time. A good starting point, but raw data on its own feels like single strikes thrown without set up: one-dimensional, uncontextualised, and ineffectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take striking, for example: landing 20 strikes in a round might seem unremarkable... until you learn the fighter only attempted 21 strikes, and their opponent only landed 3 out of their 30. Now that same fighter looks ruthlessly surgical in their attack, and acutely aware of incoming threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighters throw striking combinations, and we should follow suit: to establish a more nuanced picture of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; a fight might have played out, we need to combine raw stats in meaningful ways. This process is known as &lt;strong&gt;feature engineering&lt;/strong&gt;, and allows us to dig deeper into a fighter's style — and how it evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've described some of these derived stats below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking margin per minute&lt;/strong&gt; – Average difference between strikes landed and absorbed per minute. Positive means outstriking the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking accuracy differential&lt;/strong&gt; – Difference between a fighter’s and their opponent’s significant strike accuracy. Positive means more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking efficiency differential&lt;/strong&gt; – Difference in efficiency (significant strikes ÷ total strikes thrown). Positive means landing more high-impact strikes per overall output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net significant strikes landed&lt;/strong&gt; – Significant strikes landed minus those absorbed. Positive means outlanding the opponent in significant strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control proportion differential&lt;/strong&gt; – Difference in control time share during grounded grappling exchanges. Positive means more control than the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reigniting the Fire, or Burning Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tracked career stats for a handful of famous UFC fighters, to see if their numbers tell a story of growth and adaptation, or decline. Note that this is not a statistically rigourous analysis of post-loss improvement: these are case studies to show how we can leverage data to make inferences about a fighter's performance throughout their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rose Namajunas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thug Rose" didn't start her UFC career the way any fighters would want: she lost the TUF season 20 finale against Carla Esparza, leaving her with a 0-1 record. But, being the explosive and fast-paced striker that she is, she quickly moved past that first defeat, returning sharper and more determined. This became a defining pattern in her UFC career: in the stacked strawweight division, long win streaks are rare, but each time Namajunas suffered a defeat, she came back to beat elite opponents such as Jessica Andrade, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, and Zhang Weili. Her stats show a repeating cycle: periods where she's outperformed in striking outpur or accuracy, followed by time off, tactical and technical adjustments, and a run of successful bouts with marked improvements. Four key metrics that suggest improvements to her striking game are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Striking margin per minute: after most of her losses, Namajunas showed improvement in her striking margin per minute, suggesting an improvement to her defensive capabilities between the loss and the next fight. This is a big strength in a successful UFC fighter: being able to take a loss on the chin, learn from it, and come to your next fight better than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Namajunas Striking Margin per minute" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/namajunas_strike_margin_per_min.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Striking accuracy differential: early in her career, her striking accuracy was choppy when compared to that of her opponents, but in her last 5 fights, she has been more accurate than her opponents in all but her most recent one against Erin Blanchfield. This shows a &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Namajunas Striking Accuracy Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/namajunas_strike_accuracy_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Striking efficiency: Namajunas' striking efficiency early on showed an inability to land significant strikes without high overall striking volume. As she progressed in the UFC, she became better at identifying when to throw strikes, landing more significant strikes while throwing a lower volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Namajunas Striking Efficiency Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/namajunas_strike_efficiency_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net significant strikes landed: again, "Thug Rose" posted inconsistent net significant strikes landed stats in her early fights, but this has improved over time to be positive on a more consistent basis. This trend suggests that she is outlanding her opponents as she has gotten more experience in the Octagon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Namajunas Net Significant Strikes Landed" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/namajunas_net_sig_strikes_landed.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that her aggressiveness and pace stats have not shown an obvious improvement over time: however, what's interesting is that when these stats have been negative, Namajunas has been beaten by her opponents. This could suggest that her success in the Octagon relies on being able to control the tempo of the fight, rather than letting her opponents dictate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Charles Oliveira&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Oliveira burst onto the UFC scene with some explosive wins against some of the lower ranked fighters within his division, winning the majority of his fights by submission (which is one of the rarer ways to win a UFC fight!). However, he struggled against some of the bigger names: he lost to Donald Cerrone, Cub Swanson and Max Holloway all by KO/TKO, and lost some of his fights via submission too. Pre-2018, he had recorded 8 losses out of 19 fights - a respectable record, but a 58% win rate does not a champion make!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a noticeable turning point in his career: in 2018, Oliveira starts fighting more often, going on an 11-fight win streak, and becoming the lightweight champion. He still won by submission against the likes of Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje, but also by KO/TKO against Michael Chandler and Beneil Dariush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three interesting metrics we can look at that shed some light onto his career trajectory:
- Efficiency differential - Pre-2018, Oliveira's striking efficiency was often similar to or less than his opponents', and his efficiency was lower in 7 out of his 8 pre-2018 losses. After the start of 2018, his striking efficiency stat improved relative to his opponents, suggesting an improvement in picking when to throw his strikes and thus landing more at a given volume of strikes thrown. From this, it can be inferred that he matured and became a more competent striker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Oliveira Strike Efficiency Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/oliveira_strike_efficiency_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strike margin per minute - Charles Oliveira's strike margin was very choppy during his early career pre-2018, often dropping below 0, meaning he often took as much damage or more than he caused (in 6 of his 8 pre-2018 losses, his opponents outstruck him). After 2018, his strike margin per minute stats improved, and he often recorded positive strike margins during his 11-fight win strike, implying better striking defence and improved striking offense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Oliveira Striking Margin per minute" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/oliveira_strike_margin_per_min.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control proportion differential - similar to the other stats mentioned, Oliveira's control proportion differential was regularly negative during his early career, though interestingly not always when he lost. This could suggest weaknesses in his grappling ability to defend against sweeps, or an inability to finish a fight before the round ended and his opponent got another chance to finish the fight while standing. Despite this stat's implications, Oliveira still managed to record submission wins in his early career. From 2018 onwards, his control proportion differential was about as likely to be positive as negative (i.e. not great, but better than before!), implying a stronger wrestling and positional grappling game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Oliveira Control Proportion Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/oliveira_control_pct_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Oliveira's control proportion differential, he has won several fights where he has not had a higher share of the control time than his opponent - think of his fights against Hatsu Hioki, Myles Jury, and Kevin Lee. This is actually one of the reasons why he is considered a great UFC fighter: he is a submission hunter, and doesn't need an advantageous grappling position for long to secure a submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Darren Till&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darren Till was another exciting fighter when he started his UFC journey. A southpaw Muay Thai-style striker on paper sounds like a fan's dream: think huge, violent, sudden knockouts that could turn a fight on its head in an instant. He started decently, scoring knockdowns in fights that went the distance, and winning by KO/TKO against Wendell Marques and Donald Cerrone. However, he had a horrific performance against Tyron Woodley, hardly recording any strikes (1 landed out of a total of 7 attempted) and losing in the second round to a D'Arce choke. Including this loss, Till recorded only one other win from then on out of 6 fights, leading to the UFC cutting him from their Welterweight roster in 2023. We can look at some of his stats to get an idea of what kind of fighter he was, and what might have led to the UFC deciding to let him go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strike margin per minute - Till starts his career winning a good portion of his fights via decision, and as such, takes a reasonable amount of damage from his opponents - having said that, he also dishes it out too, often outstriking his opponents. From the Woodley fight onwards however, he is regularly beaten on the feet, with his opponents landing considerably more punches than Till lands. Some of his worst recorded strike margins have interestingly come from fights where he was beaten by submission too, possibly highlighting that he struggled to defend himself from strikes or submissions when the fight was taken to the ground. The more negative values may also show that he struggled to turn the tables when his opponents were outstriking him, meaning that once the fight started to run away from him, it was basically over for Till.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Till Strike Margin per minute" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/till_strike_margin_per_min.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency differential - Darren Till's efficiency metric tells a similar story: at the start of his career, he picked his strikes well and landed a good portion of them. But then, he started to fight higher quality opponents: from the Cerrone fight, this metric dropped and hovered around 0, indicating he wasn't landing any more strikes in a given volume thrown than his opponent. This could indicate that maybe he had reached his highest level, which unfortunately did not allow him to compete with the bigger names in his division.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Till Strike Efficiency Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/till_strike_efficiency_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control proportion differential - Till didn't often dominate grappling exchanges, shown by negative control proportion differentials - this aligns with his preferred fighting method of striking. Being a specialist has hardly ever worked in the sport of MMA (in fact, it was a key lesson in the early days of the sport: fighters realised you can't do one martial art and expect to beat everyone!), and Till's lack of grappling prowess led to his defeats later in his career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Till Control Proportion Differential" src="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/images/strikes-slumps-and-comebacks/till_control_pct_diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should remind you: these stats aren't a crystal ball into predicting the next UFC champion. I don't pretend to draw any causal relationships between these stats (or any others for that matter) and the outcome of fights in the Octagon. But they do offer another lens through which to analyse the chaotic nature of mixed martial arts, and another perspective on fighters' performances. Rose Namajunas reflected, adapted, and succeeded after big losses. Charles Oliveira turned his career from a potentially mediocre one to one involving a huge win streak, a championship belt, and a reputation as being one of the most dangerous grapplers in the UFC. And Darren Till swung for the fences, but eventually was forced to bow out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is just an illustration of why this data is useful, justifying further research into this space. What if we can leverage these numbers to predict who will win in the next UFC event? What if we can use this data to predict how long a match is likely to go on for, or how it will end? And if we can do all of those things, could we walk the walk and put our money where our mouths are, and place smarter wagers on these events with the edge that these metrics give us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll find out in later articles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="MMA Analytics"></category><category term="time series"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="mma"></category><category term="UFC"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="fight stats"></category></entry><entry><title>Scraps and Scrapes: Web Scraping UFC Fight Data</title><link href="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/data-scraping.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oscar Kelly</name></author><id>tag:optimal-kombat.github.io,2025-06-19:/data-scraping.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A technical overview of how I used Python and BeautifulSoup to build a UFC dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Why Data Quality is Important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a well-known saying in the data industry that describes how your model's predictive capabilities will never be significantly better than the quality of the training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sh*t in = sh*t out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before we can do any thought-provoking analysis, we need some good data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Straight to the Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the UFC are kind enough to provide data on all of their events down to the round-level, via the &lt;a href="http://www.ufcstats.com"&gt;UFCstats&lt;/a&gt; website. Under the &lt;em&gt;Events and Fights&lt;/em&gt; section, you can select individual fights from any event and see striking and grappling stats for each fighter in each of the rounds fought - it also includes other data such as the final scorecards (if it was a decision), the referee, and the weightclass at which the fighters fought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of UFCstats doesn't have everything unfortunately - some missing data includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round-by-round scorecards (though in hindsight, I don't know if the UFC actually publish these anyway...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a fighter missed weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fighter's stance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Bruce Buffer introduces them (where he calls them "a striker", or a "brawler" - I've always wondered how they decide who's what kind of fighter... We'll be exploring this in a later article!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some of the missing data, I believe I can collect this at a later date, and include it as fighter metadata in analysis going forward. But for the start of this project, I wanted to collect the stats from each fight. This would enable me to do a couple of things: first, I can see how fighters have performed over time, from the start of their career to the present day. Secondly, I can calculate some other interesting stats that often come up when talking about UFC fighters - e.g. SLpM (Strikes Landed per Minute) can be calculated from a fighter's total strikes landed and the length of each fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessing the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, accessing this potential goldmine of data is very difficult - there's no download button, and no API that I could find that was freely available. But the website did have a consistent structure for every fight in every event for the last 15 or so years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unacquainted, &lt;code&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;web scraping&lt;/em&gt; python package, letting you pull data from websites, provided they have a consistent HTML structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through the steps I used to create my starting dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Scrape All Event URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already identified the data source, but now we need to access each of the events in turn, so we can gather the data from their respective fights. I began by extracting event-level data using the structure of the UFCStats events page, which lists every completed UFC event. From there, I generated a list of events that could be processed one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Extract All Fights From Each Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I identified the individual fights within each event to build a complete timeline of UFC bouts. These fights were then used to create a list of all UFC fights that have taken place since around 2009 (I didn't want to collect data that was too old, but decided that UFC100 was a good starting point, since it would include active UFC veterans and had the same HTML structure as more recent events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Scrape Fight-Level Stats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using another function, I iterated through the fight URLs to access the data associated with each fight. I pulled as much as I could from the page, starting with the fight-level data, then moving onto each of the individual rounds. The scraper had to be dynamic, as some fights ended early in round 1, while some went the full distance (either 3 rounds for normal fights, or 5 rounds for fights with a belt on the line/headline fights). So, I structured the scraper to handle up to five rounds per fight, using a consistent format that accounts for fights ending early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fight statistics, I collected data related to the fight itself: who the referee was, the fight length in seconds, the judges' names and scorecards if the fight ended in a decision, and the method of victory, amongst others. These statistics will allow me to add extra information to my models, and look into predicting things like how fights might end, rather than just if they will finish inside the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now faced a problem: how should I be storing this data? I couldn't set up a dictionary with all of the UFC fighters names - ~~that would take too long and I'm too lazy~~ it would be inefficient. If a new fighter came along, I would have to add their name to the dictionary before I could pull data for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Python already had a solution: the &lt;code&gt;defaultdict&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;collections&lt;/code&gt; module won't throw a KeyError if you pass a new key into it like a normal dictionary would. Instead, it seamlessly creates a new key for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Time Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled all of the fight data I could from every fight since UFC100 - thousands of fights, with hundreds of data points in each. After a full run across historical events, I saved the resulting dataset locally — a rich record of thousands of fights. I then tried to plot some data for a fighter over a period of time, to see how their stats had changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One rather crucial piece of data was missing from the fight pages... The date the fight took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back at the drawing board, I developed a way to link each fight to its corresponding event date using metadata from the event pages. Armed with this, I could modify the data scraping function to add this date in as metadata alongside the fight data, ensuring that I could create time series from the &lt;code&gt;defaultdict&lt;/code&gt; at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final data object looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Max Holloway&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Ilia Topuria&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;metadata&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Fighter_1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Ilia Topuria&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Fighter_2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Max Holloway&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Weight_Class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;UFC Featherweight Title Bout&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;2024-10-26&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;stats&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;FIGHT_KD_1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;FIGHT_KD_2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;url&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Justin Gaethje&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nested dictionary above stores each fighter's fights as keys, mapping to lists of dictionaries with their fight metadata and statistics. This structure lets us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly access a fighter's historical stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform time-based filtering using the "Date" field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track changes in performance against different opponents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! Now we have a rather complex but rich dataset that can be used in all sorts of analysis projects. We have a time component that will allow for time series analysis, plenty of numerical and categorical data to allow basic analysis such as comparing different stats between fighters, or more complex analysis such as predicting who is likely to win a bout in a future event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that data acquisition and cleaning is 80% of a data scientist's job, and only around 20% is spent actually doing the fun stuff like modelling, predicting, and drawing conclusions from the data. We will now be moving onto that 20% in the next article, where we'll use this dataset to create visual timelines of fighter stats, starting with some familiar names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, feel free to let me know if you enjoyed this article, if there's anything you think I've missed, and what you would like to see next!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="MMA Analytics"></category><category term="scraping"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="UFC"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="BeautifulSoup"></category></entry><entry><title>How I Built This Website with Pelican</title><link href="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/how-i-built-this.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oscar Kelly</name></author><id>tag:optimal-kombat.github.io,2025-06-16:/how-i-built-this.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A technical overview of how I used Python and Pelican to build my MMA analytics site.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into any analysis, I needed somewhere to house all of the amazing insights that will change the face of the MMA world - and by extension, the actual world - forever. But if all of the analysis turns out to be rubbish, at least I'll be able to say that all my failings are housed on a website I built from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is powered by &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in Python. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Here’s how I built it from scratch, and how you can too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Set Up Python &amp;amp; Pelican&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;strong&gt;Anaconda Prompt&lt;/strong&gt; to create the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;markdown
pelican-quickstart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate a series of questions for you to answer about the site name, URL, author, and deployment options. I chose GitHub Pages to host the website, but there are options for S3, Dropbox, and more. This will guide the package in how to build your website and the folder structure that you will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Create a Post&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the folders generated by pelican, there will be a &lt;code&gt;content/posts/&lt;/code&gt; folder - this is where your articles should be stored so that they are properly generated on the website at the end. Each article should be a markdown file with a header, containing key metadata that will be shown in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: My first post
Date: 2025-06-16
Tags: mma, analytics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can edit these markdown files in whatever text editor you prefer to use - I used VS Code with its Markdown preview functionality, so I can see what the post would look like in real time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Choosing a Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you can add some flair to your currently drab website - you can create a file called &lt;code&gt;custom.css&lt;/code&gt; that houses your styling instructions for the website. To apply the CSS file to your post, add the stylesheet reference in the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file, and modify the &lt;code&gt;base.html&lt;/code&gt; file inside the &lt;code&gt;theme&lt;/code&gt; directory. This can feel a bit convoluted and isn't essential, but it definitely adds something to your website that makes it feel unique!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Preview the Website Locally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now be in a position to have a look at your website, to see what your users will see when they get there. You can run the following code to host a preview of your website locally on your machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;content
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;output
python&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;http.server&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will host the website on a port on your machine, which you can access by typing &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt; into your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 5: Push the Website to GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to share your website with the wider world, you'll need to host it online. One free way to do this is by creating a GitHub repository, naming it the same as your desired website URL, and running the following from the project root in the Anaconda prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;add&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;commit&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Initial commit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remote&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;add&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git@github.com:&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;REPO_PATH&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-u&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a minute or so, you should be able to access your website via the URL you specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the blog is about exploring the sport of MMA through a data lens, I thought it was important to briefly cover the details of how this website came to be - building this platform has given me a way to shape how I present ideas, try new functionality, and creatively craft a story around the technical side of any analysis. Hopefully, it also makes reading it all a bit more enjoyable too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="portfolio"></category><category term="website"></category></entry><entry><title>Starting the Fight: Launching Optimal Kombat</title><link href="https://optimal-kombat.github.io/starting-the-fight.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Oscar Kelly</name></author><id>tag:optimal-kombat.github.io,2025-06-12:/starting-the-fight.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Intro to Optimal Kombat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Optimal Kombat – where we use data to decode the fight game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first post is a quick overview of why I started this project, what kind of analysis I'm building, and how you can help shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Oscar, a trading analyst who uses Python in my job and has a passion for sports. I played as a prop in rugby throughout school and uni, but decided that I was done standing around in the rain on a pitch in the middle of winter and wanted to move to a different sport. One I could do year-round and inside, with a lower incidence of injury perhaps... Which is why I picked Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still the small but non-zero chance of some pretty devastating injuries, I was immediately hooked onto BJJ after being tapped 8 times in a single 5-minute round by someone half my size - I love learning new things, and there are plenty of techniques and facets to the sport, both in the gi and in no gi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also opened me up to the world of martial arts, and exposed me to MMA. Whilst I had heard of and seen MMA before, I had rather naively seen it as, "boxing but more violent and with grappling" up to this point - now, I had a new appreciation for the grappling aspect of the sport: the contrast between the overt violent melee, and the subtle techniques, tactics and strategy creates a fantastic spectator sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What This Blog Is About&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember watching baseball with my brother one holiday when we were kids, and seeing all of these acronyms: we had no idea what OBP or RBI meant, or why they were worth showing on screen as batters stepped up to the plate. To me, American sports have always had more of a focus on the statistical side of sports, both at a team and a player level, than other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder: why &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; there stats in other sports?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMA seems like a good candidate for investigating this: the UFC is a huge promotion, and dominates the MMA sport (some people use the terms "UFC" and "MMA" interchangably when talking about watching the sport!). They collect a vast array of different data during the course of a fight: number of strikes landed vs thrown, takedown attempts, significant strikes landed to the opponent's body, significant strikes landed from the clinch position,... Not to mention, this data is collected at the fight level and at the round level: so, a 5-round fight generates a huge amount of data, and with several fights every event, there are thousands of data points generated every month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just my ignorance, but I think that this data gets generated, collected,... and largely ignored. What are the implications of this data? Could we look at an incoming fighter and judge how they will perform against a particular opponent? Can we use some of this data to predict if a fight will go the distance or finish early, and how might it finish? Is there a way to evaluate fighters before a fight, to see if one is severely over- or undervalued in terms of betting odds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Purpose of This Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman, strategist and writer, wrote: "When you know the way broadly, you see it in all things". Starting BJJ has made me look at other aspects of my life differently, particularly when looking at learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned how to code only in the last few years, and already I feel comfortable using it to automate a lot of my work on a day-to-day basis. However, I feel like I have rushed past some things, and neglected to practice other things that I learned, didn't require at the time, and so have forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of this blog is to help give me a reason to practice these skills, and learn new ones along the way, as well as to put myself out there and try to do something new, no matter how I feel about my chances of succeeding. I'm sure there will be flaws in the analysis I do to begin with, and as time goes on, I may revisit previous articles with better methods and a greater understanding. But this is all part of an effort to improve what I can do, expand my skillset, and apply myself to an area I find exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall goal is to use Python to break down fight data, uncover trends, and model fight outcomes and aspects of a fight. This blog will track my journey as I build analytics tools, test predictive models, and explore fighter performance from a data-driven lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is exploratory in nature, so currently there is no defined direction, but here are a few ideas I'm excited to dive into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time series evolution of fighters’ stats - who learns from their mistakes, and who gets left behind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighter style clustering - how does Bruce Buffer know how to describe fighters in his intros before a fight starts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pace &amp;amp; fatigue analysis - do the young bucks have a significant advantage over the veterans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-fight modeling &amp;amp; betting implications - can this data be used to shape how fans talk about this sport, shifting away from intangible qualities and towards data-driven insights?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give Me Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably premature and a little bit self-indulgent, but in case you do read this and comes back for the articles later on, I’d love to hear your thoughts! What kind of insights are you curious about? Do you want visual breakdowns of matchups? Deeper dives into performance analytics? Tutorials or code walkthroughs? Any ideas, thoughts, comments or feedback (however brutal) would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment (coming soon), DM me, or message me &lt;a href="https://github.com/optimal-kombat"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s find patterns in the chaos — together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="MMA Analytics"></category><category term="scraping"></category><category term="UFC"></category><category term="MMA"></category></entry></feed>
