### Introduction

> *"I never lose. I either win or learn."*

Yeah, he was a great fighter, but what the hell does that guy know about losing, considering he was undefeated in the UFC and retired with a 29-0-0 record?

The saying, *"What goes around, comes around"*, seems very poignant in sports: at some point, you're going to lose (unless you're Khabib). And while a loss in most sports isn't too devastating, in combat sports, a loss or two can be the inflection point of your career. Without a good win rate, fickle fans can turn on a fighter, and they can find themselves getting dropped from the UFC roster after only a few loses.

But truly great fighters don't just win: they lose, and come back better.

People love an underdog: we see ourselves in those who fail, and find it cathartic watching them come back to eventually succeed. 

By turning fight history into time series, we’ll attempt to answer a deceptively simple question: **Do UFC fighters get better after they lose?**
